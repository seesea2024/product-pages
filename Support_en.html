    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <q>
        <p>Q: Why do I need to grant photo library access?</p>
        <p>A: Photo Cleaner requires access to your photo library to display, review, and manage your photos. All operations are performed locally on your device – your photos are never uploaded to any server.</p>
    </q>

    <q>
        <p>Q: Will deleting photos with this app permanently remove them from my device?</p>
        <p>A: Yes, when you confirm deletion, photos are permanently removed from your device's photo library. They cannot be recovered after deletion. Please review your selection carefully before confirming.</p>
    </q>

    <q>
        <p>Q: Does this app work with iCloud Photos?</p>
        <p>A: Yes, Photo Cleaner Lit e works with iCloud Photos. Please note that deletion actions may sync across your other devices connected to the same iCloud account.</p>
    </q>

    <q>
        <p>Q: Can I undo a deletion after confirming?</p>
        <p>A: No, once a photo is deleted, it cannot be restored through this app. We recommend reviewing photos carefully in the "Pending Deletion" list before confirming deletion.</p>
    </q>

    <q>
        <p>Q: Is my photo data uploaded to any cloud server?</p>
        <p>A: No. All photo viewing, selection, and deletion operations happen entirely on your local device. Your privacy is our top priority.</p>
    </q>

    <q>
        <p>Q: The app shows "No photos found" – what should I do?</p>
        <p>A: This means your photo library is currently empty or inaccessible. Try adding some photos to your device first, or check your photo library permissions in iOS Settings.</p>
    </q>

    <q>
        <p>Q: How do I restore photos from the deletion list?</p>
        <p>A: In the "Pending Deletion" screen, you can tap on any photo to view it, or use the "Restore All" button to remove all photos from the deletion queue at once.</p>
    </q>
