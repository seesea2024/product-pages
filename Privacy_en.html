    <h1>Privacy Policy for Image Cleaner</h1>
    
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 4, 2026</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for using Image Cleaner. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data and protect your privacy when using our application.</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>Image Cleaner is committed to protecting your privacy. We understand that your photos contain personal and sensitive information, and we take the security of your data very seriously. This app is designed with privacy as a core principle.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Image Cleaner processes all your photos <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your photos on our servers. All photo viewing, selection, and deletion operations happen entirely within your device.</p>
    
    <p><strong>No Cloud Uploads:</strong> Your photos are never uploaded to any cloud service or external server as part of using this application.</p>

    <h2>3. Information We Access</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> With your explicit permission, Image Cleaner accesses your device's photo library to display, organize, and help you manage your photos. This access is necessary for the app to function.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Device Storage:</strong> The app may temporarily cache thumbnails or metadata locally to improve performance. This data is stored only on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do NOT collect, upload, or transmit your photos to any server</li>
        <li>We do NOT collect personal information such as your name, email, or location</li>
        <li>We do NOT use third-party analytics services to track your usage</li>
        <li>We do NOT share any data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
        <li>We do NOT require account registration or login</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>When you use Image Cleaner to delete photos, those photos are permanently removed from your device's photo library. This action is final and cannot be undone through the app. Please review your selection carefully before confirming deletion.</p>
    
    <p>Uninstalling Image Cleaner from your device will remove any temporary data the app may have stored locally. Your actual photos and photo library remain intact and managed by iOS unless you have explicitly deleted them through the app.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Image Cleaner does not use any third-party services that collect or process your data. The app functions independently without external dependencies that could compromise your privacy.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security practices to protect your data:
    <ul>
        <li>All operations are performed locally on your device</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted over networks, reducing security risks</li>
        <li>We follow Apple's best practices for iOS app development</li>
        <li>Regular updates ensure the app remains secure and compatible with iOS</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Image Cleaner does not collect personal information and is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
